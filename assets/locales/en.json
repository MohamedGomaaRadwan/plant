  "farmingTips1": "When buying a new ornamental plant and while transporting it to the house, it must be protected - with a plastic cover - because most nursery plants grow in a protected greenhouse and any sudden change in temperature during transportation may affect them",

Fertilization is used with leftover tea and coffee grounds with irrigation.\nIt is possible to fertilize with NPK compounds , a higher nitrogen concentration by a small spoonful on a liter of irrigation water once every 15 days. ( To learn more about NPK compounds, you can see their section in the Fertilizers section )\n",
  "farmingTips3": "When preparing the planting pot or the planting container, it is necessary to make a hole or holes - according to the size of the pot - and take into account placing small stones - gravel - on the hole from the inside before placing the soil in order to prevent clogging the hole, which may lead to damage and rotting of the roots due to lack of drainage water",

It is noted that excessive irrigation harms the plant and may lead to rot. The plant then dies.",
  "farmingTips10": "Leafy plants need higher nitrogen fertilization\nFlowering plants need more phosphorous fertilizer\nPlants with colored leaves need iron to show the strength of color\n",
  "farmingTips11": "When the plant is transferred to a new environment - a new house, for example - or when it is planted for the first time in the pot, the fertilizer is not added for a period of 3 months until it adapts to the environment",
  "farmingTips12": "The surface of the plant leaves must be cleaned of the dust accumulated on it, because it leads to clogging the stomata in the leaf, which reduces the efficiency of the plant and the difficulty of performing vital tasks such as respiration and photosynthesis",
